        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I am an 18 year old Computer Science student with experience in HTML/CSS/JS, Python, GD Script, Java, and Oracle SQL.  
            I have been programming since I was 14, and my fascination with game development and web apps has driven me to learn
            as much as possible.  I have a certificate in Software Technology from the Ogden Weber Tech College, and I am continuing
            my education at Weber State University to get a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.  More about my education and 
            projects can be found <a href="projects.html">here.</a>
            <br><br>
            My other interests include cars, motorcycles, music, and anything DIY.  More about that can be found <a href="projects.html">here. </a>
