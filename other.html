        <h3>Audio Equipment and Records</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I inherited this old JVC stero system from my grandparents, and it has been a 
            great starter setup.  It didn't come with a turntable, but I bought an Audio Technica
            LP60x to go with it.  I'm hoping to upgrade soon, and I have an extra Akai stereo I found at
            a garage sale that has yet to be tested.  It needs new belts for the cassette deck and turntable,
            but it should be finished soon.  A few of my favorite records are Loveless - My Bloody Valentine, 
            Little Dark Age - MGMT, and Wildflower - The Avalanches.  
        </p>

        <h3>Motorcycyle</h3>
        <h5>Honda XL250S</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When I got this bike from my uncle, it was torn apart and needed to be almost completely rewired.
            It took me about a months worth of work (about 80 hours) to get this bike running but it has been worth
            every second.  There is a small oil leak still though, and I'm planning to do a top end engine rebuild
            in the winter.  I just want to be able to enjoy the bike while there is still good weather.
        </p>

        <h3>Computer</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I originally built this computer when I was 16, but I've continued to upgrade it enough so it
            always feels new.  
        </p>
        <h4>Specifications:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ryzen 5 2500</li>
            <li>16GB DDR4 Memory</li>
            <li>Nvidia RTX 2060 6GB</li>
            <li>512GB SSD</li>
            <li>1TB HDD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not bad considering I only play Fallout New Vegas and Minecraft.</p>
