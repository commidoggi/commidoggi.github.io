        <h3>PySong</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This was developed as my final project for my Python 3 course
            at Ogden Weber Tech College.  It uses tkinter as it's GUI framework,
            mutagen for ID3 tag management(song metadata), and FFMPEG for file 
            conversion for MP3.  I wasn't happy with existing conversion and tagging
            tools so I made my own that combined both.
            <br>
            Source code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/commidoggi/PySong">here.</a>

        <h3>Dungeon Game</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This is a simple game I made for my capstone project for the Software
            Technology program.  It is very unpolished and doesn't have menus, as it
            was made to improve my GD Script skills and experiment with simple procedural generation.
            Rooms were made using a custom tilemap exporter for Godot, and then the game would
            load in random rooms from the game files during runtime to generate the world.  Some optimization
            was done to increase performance once worlds became large, but there are still many bugs with the system.
            Also the avatar features a png of the rapper Drake because Godot would refuse to compile the game
            if it wasn't present in the files and visible.  I learned a lot about tilemaps and vector math from this project
            and hope to experiment with Godot more in the future.
            <br>
            A download of the game can be found <a href="downloads/Game.zip">here.</a>
